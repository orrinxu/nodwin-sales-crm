## [Unreleased]

Work in flight on feature branches (not yet merged to `main`): admin landing page,
ORR-661, and cash-flow milestone follow-ups.

## 2026-07-17

### Fixed

- **RAG retrieval was a full sequential scan of `document_chunks` on every query (perf audit, ORR-756):** the embedding column was an unsized `vector`, so no ANN index could exist and `search_document_chunks` did an exact seq-scan + full sort, O(N_chunks), on each knowledge search. The column is now pinned to **`vector(768)`** (the `nomic-embed-text` dimension the deployment standardises on) with an **HNSW cosine index**, and the RPC is rewritten so the `ORDER BY embedding <=> query LIMIT k` actually uses the index (the old `MATERIALIZED` CTE bypassed it) while keeping the per-tier entitlement gate intact — with `hnsw.ef_search` + `iterative_scan` (pgvector 0.8) tuned so the entitlement filter can't starve recall. `_match_count` is now also clamped to 50 **in SQL** (the ORR-630 clamp previously lived only in TS, so a non-web caller could force a huge materialise+sort). The embedding **model** stays runtime-configurable (any other 768-dim model needs no migration); a different-dimension model needs a re-pin migration + re-embed. 8-assertion pgTAP covers entitlement, the model/dim guards and the clamp.
- **Opportunity / account / contact lists silently truncated past 1000 rows (perf audit, ORR-755):** `getOpportunities`, `getAccounts` and `getContacts` requested `count:'exact'` but had no `.limit()`/`.range()`, so the UI showed the true total while PostgREST's 1000-row cap silently dropped the rest of the data — the same truncation class as the dashboard-metrics fix. The three lists are now **server-driven**: search, filter, sort and paging move to the query string and drive a bounded `.range()` query, so no page ever fetches more than one page of rows.

### Changed

- **Server-driven pagination for the opportunity / account / contact lists (ORR-755):** the hot tables previously fetched every row and did search/filter/sort **client-side** over the full array. They now push those controls to the URL and re-fetch a single server-paginated page (`DEFAULT_PAGE_SIZE = 25`), with a shared `ListPagination` footer, debounced search, and server-side sort. Opportunity search matches deal **name OR account name** (account ids pre-resolved into one bounded query). Saved views map to/from the URL params; bulk stage/delete and RLS scoping are unchanged.
- **Opportunities board no longer fetches unbounded (ORR-755):** the kanban board can't paginate, so it now pulls a **bounded** set of cards (cap 500, most-recently-updated) and renders **accurate per-stage column totals over the full scope** from a new `pipeline_metrics_agg_scoped()` RPC (RLS-scoped, per stage × currency, probability-weighted, honouring the owner-scope / close-date / entity narrowing). A "showing N of M" note appears when the card set is capped; the Board/Table toggle is now a navigation since each view fetches different data. 6-assertion pgTAP proves the scoped aggregation.

### Fixed

- **Dashboard headline metrics silently under-reported past 1000 deals (perf audit):** `getPipelineMetrics` and `getPipelineSummary` fetched **every** opportunity and reduced in JS, so PostgREST's 1000-row cap silently truncated pipeline value, win rate, avg deal size and per-stage totals with no error once a tenant crossed 1000 deals. They now fold a bounded **`pipeline_metrics_agg()`** GROUP BY RPC (per stage × currency) through `fetchAndConvert` at today's rate — mirroring the existing `forecast_pipeline_agg` pattern — preserving the exact prior semantics (deal_count as the per-bucket multiplier; unconvertible = total − converted). 3-assertion pgTAP proves the aggregation.

### Changed

- **Performance (perf audit):** added `idx_opportunities_updated_at (updated_at DESC)` + `idx_opportunities_owner_updated (owner_user_id, updated_at DESC)` — the main opportunities list and dashboard recent-deals sort by `updated_at` but had no supporting index. And the opportunities list page now runs its three independent enrichments (`attachDealHealth`, `attachLineItemsWarning`, `getStageTotals`) in one `Promise.all` instead of a ~4-hop serial chain.

- **AI provider env reads go through the validated boundary + `.env.example` reconciled (ORR-730):** the `lib/ai/providers/*` adapters (Anthropic, Gemini, DeepSeek, Moonshot, Ollama, OpenAI-compatible + the env-fallback builder) now read their API keys / models via `@/lib/security/env` instead of raw `process.env`, completing the ARCH-1 migration; the eslint `no-process-env` exemption for those files is removed. `index.test.ts` now mocks the env boundary rather than mutating `process.env`. Separately, `.env.example` is reconciled to `env-schema.ts`: fixed the `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_*` → `SUPABASE_*` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` → `APP_URL` name drift, added the required `POSTMARK_WEBHOOK_SECRET` + `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` and all the AI provider key/model vars, and dropped stale unused entries (SMTP\_\*, `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`). Hygiene only — no runtime/security behaviour change (the security portion shipped earlier in #299).

### Added

- **Per-rep quarterly sales targets + "Quarter target" on the dashboard (ORR-726):** admins set a **closed-won revenue quota per rep per quarter** on a new **Sales Targets** admin page (Organization nav) — a per-user grid with prev/next quarter navigation. Reps see a **Quarter target** card in their dashboard "My numbers": **won-so-far vs target** with an attainment bar, plus **weighted pipeline** for the quarter. All figures FX-convert to the reporting currency (reusing `fetchAndConvert`). Global (per-user) `sales_targets` table (unique per user/year/quarter; RLS: a rep reads their own, admins read/write all; 8-assertion pgTAP). Pure calendar-quarter helpers unit-tested. Settles ORR-719 G4's codification (closed-won revenue, quarterly, per-rep). Fiscal-quarter alignment + a team-rollup view are follow-ups.
- **Tasks / follow-ups with due dates + "My tasks" on the dashboard (ORR-725):** a real `tasks` entity (distinct from the `task` activity type, which had no due date) — title, description, due date, priority, status (open/done), assignable to **any user** (defaults to the creator), and an optional link to a **deal / account / contact** (or standalone). New **"My tasks"** dashboard section: open tasks bucketed **Overdue / Today / Upcoming / No date**, complete inline via a checkbox, and a quick-add (title + due date). RLS keeps a task visible to its assignee, creator, or an admin (creators can delete); 9-assertion pgTAP. Pure due-date bucketing helper is unit-tested; the widget is component-tested. Settles ORR-719 G3's codification (link-any-record + standalone, any-user assignee). A per-deal Tasks section on the opportunity page is a follow-up.
- **"Line items" badge on the pipeline board (ORR-753 follow-up):** deals flagged by the line-items requirement now also show a warning **Line items** badge on their kanban card (alongside Hot / overdue / stale), so at-risk deals are visible from the board without opening each one. Computed in one batched pass (`attachLineItemsWarning`) over the scoped list — one settings read + at most two id-scoped queries, never per-card, mirroring `attachDealHealth`. `OpportunityRecord` gained an optional `needsLineItems` flag. Unit-tested; no migration.
- **Admin setting: require line items from a configurable stage (ORR-753):** a new **Sales Process** admin page (under Automation & AI) lets an admin pick the deal stage from which **line items are expected** — early stages (Qualify) only need the overall amount, but by e.g. **Verbal Agreement** the itemized breakdown should be filled in. It's a **warning, not a hard block**: a deal that has reached the configured stage with no line items shows an amber banner on its detail page ("Line items are expected from the … stage — add them in the Products tab"). A second toggle controls whether a **manually-overridden** deal amount waives the requirement. Global (singleton) `sales_process_settings` table (read = all authenticated, write = admin; 6-assertion pgTAP), a pure `lineItemsRequirementUnmet` rule (unit-tested — off/before-stage/at-stage/won/lost/override cases), no stage-write-path gate. Follows on from the ORR-704 products/line-items feature.
- **Line-item read-view + catalog cost + currency lock (ORR-752, §E of ORR-704 — closes the epic):** the opportunity **Overview** tab now shows a read-only **Products & line items** breakdown (per-line qty/price/discount/total + subtotal/discount/deal amount) when a deal has lines, so the composition is visible without opening the editor. The admin **product catalog** form gained a **Unit Cost** input (persisted via the data layer added in §D). And the deal's **Currency** field is now **locked while the deal has line items** (they're priced in that currency, so changing it would mis-scale them) — the multi-currency edge. Board totals / forecast / reports need no change: they read `opportunities.amount`, which §C keeps authoritative. Component-tested; no migration. This completes the products / line-items feature (ORR-704, §A–§E).
- **Line-item editor on the deal (ORR-751, §D of ORR-704):** a new **Products** tab on the opportunity detail page lets reps build a deal from line items — a repeating-row editor (product picker from the catalog + custom off-catalog lines, quantity, unit price, per-line % discount, live per-line and deal totals), a per-deal fixed discount, and the manual-override toggle. Saving replaces the lines and applies the pricing atomically (`saveOpportunityLineItemsAction` → the ORR-749/750 RPCs), and the deal amount recomputes server-side. The **Amount field in the edit form is now read-only** when a deal has line items and isn't overridden ("Derived from line items — edit in the Products tab"). The product catalog data layer now surfaces `unitCostAmount` (used to prefill a line's cost). Component-tested; no migration. Read-view breakdown + admin-settable catalog cost are §E follow-ups.
- **Deal amount derived from line items (ORR-750, §C of ORR-704):** the deal amount is now computed from its line items — `opportunities.amount = Σ line_total − per-deal fixed discount`, floored at 0 — and written back into the authoritative `amount` column so every existing rollup (forecast/scorecard aggregates, stage totals, reports, per-account) keeps working unchanged. New columns: `line_items_amount_overridden` (a per-deal **override toggle** — pins a manual amount, lines become informational) and `line_items_discount_amount` (per-deal fixed discount, deal currency). A deal with **no** line items keeps its manual amount. Recompute runs inside the two SECURITY DEFINER write paths — `replace_opportunity_line_items` (now recomputes after swapping lines) and a new `set_opportunity_line_items_pricing(_id, discount, overridden)` — both authorised via `can_write_opportunity_line_items` and row-locked; never a table trigger. Data layer gained `getOpportunityLineItemsSummary` (previews subtotal/discount/total the same way the DB does) + `setOpportunityLineItemsPricing`. 7-assertion pgTAP (derive, discount, override-pins, override-off-rederives, zero-floor, line-less-stays-manual, auth) + unit tests. The revenue-schedule "months must sum to amount" invariant now validates against the derived amount automatically (it reads `amount`). **Line-item editor UI is §D (ORR-751)** — no UI wires these RPCs yet.
- **Opportunity line items — schema + data layer (ORR-749, §B of ORR-704):** new `public.opportunity_line_items` table (product × quantity × unit price, optional per-line % discount, optional custom off-catalog lines via nullable `product_id`, stored `unit_cost` for later margin). All amounts are in the **deal's currency**; `line_total` is a **generated** column (`qty × unit_price × (1 − discount%)`). RLS **tracks the parent opportunity's visibility** with the same confidential fence as `opportunity_splits` (explicit-visibility branch unfenced, admin/role-scope branches fenced). Whole-set writes go through an atomic `replace_opportunity_line_items` RPC (DELETE+INSERT in one txn, owner/admin-authorised, row-locked), mirroring `replace_revenue_schedule`. Data layer `lib/data/opportunity-line-items.ts` (Money-correct, unit-tested) + 9-assertion pgTAP. Catalog gained a default `unit_cost_amount`. **Deal-amount rollup from these lines is §C (ORR-750)** — this ships the schema + write path only; nothing changes the deal amount yet.
- **Product catalog (ORR-748, §A of ORR-704):** a new admin **Products** screen (`/admin/products`, under Data) for managing a catalog of sellable products/services — name, SKU, unit price, sort order, active status — with create / edit / deactivate. New `public.products` table (uuid PK, so per-deal line items can reference it in ORR-749) whose unit price is an `(amount, currency)` Money pair; RLS reads = all authenticated, writes = admin only; 13 pgTAP assertions cover the RLS + constraints. Data layer `lib/data/products.ts` follows the `relationship-types` pattern; unit-tested. First slice of the products/line-items feature — schema (§B), amount rollup (§C) and the deal-side line-item editor (§D) are separate tickets.
- **Generic CSV import for Accounts (ORR-731):** a new "Import accounts from CSV" card on `/admin/data-management` takes an arbitrary CSV (not just a Salesforce export) and creates accounts. Columns are matched to fields by header name against an alias table (`Name`/`Company` → name; plus optional Legal Name, Website, Country, Industry, Description), so no per-import mapping UI is needed for the common cases; bare-domain websites are normalised to `https://…`. Rows whose name already exists (case-insensitive, paged scan to dodge the PostgREST 1000-row truncation) are **skipped**, so re-uploading the same file — or a double-click — won't duplicate. Each run writes an `import_jobs` audit row now carrying `record_count` + `error_log` (both columns existed but were unpopulated; `createImportJob` was extended). Reuses the ORR-699 `parseCsv` and `createAccount` (admin RLS, `created_by` trigger, audit). Contacts (account linking) and Opportunities (name→id resolution) are follow-ups.

### Docs

- **Corrected the last stale secret-scanning references (ORR-602):** `docs/SOW.md` + `docs/_sources/SOW-v1.1.md` §9.5 item 5 described secret scanning as a **pre-commit hook** — the as-built runs **gitleaks in `deploy.yml`'s `checks` job on every push** (the standalone `secret-scan.yml` gate was descoped over a license issue; the pre-commit hook runs only the RLS linter). The other files flagged in the ticket (`README.md`, `BUILD_TICKETS.md`, `paperclip-org-chart.md`) were already reconciled by the #242 accuracy sweep.

## 2026-07-13

### Added

- **"My focus" dashboard hub + My / Team / Group scope switcher (ORR-719, #285):** the homepage is now a single-rep, action-first hub — curated, labelled sections (**Needs your attention → My numbers → My pipeline → Recent**) behind a **My / Team / Group** switcher (SOW §17's three-tier split). The cross-rep widgets (rep leaderboard + conversion funnel) relocate to a **Team** tab; **Group** is a shell for region/exec rollups (follow-up ORR-723). New `DashboardTabs` (client switcher) + `DashboardSection`; `dashboard/page.tsx` builds server-rendered section nodes passed as props to the switcher. This sets aside the draggable "Edit layout" grid on the homepage (revisiting gate G6) in favour of the curated hub — `DashboardGrid` + the layout persistence stay in the tree, just no longer mounted on the homepage.
- **"Needs a touch" + Reconnect CTA on the dashboard (ORR-719, #284):** the "Needs my attention" widget's stale bucket is now **"Needs a touch"** (deals ranked by time since last activity, `MAX(activities.created_at)`, owner-scoped), and its Overdue + Needs-a-touch rows get a **Reconnect** button that opens a small dialog to log a real touch (call / email / meeting / note) against the deal via `createActivity` — recording it resets the deal's last-contact clock so it drops off the list. New `logTouchAction` + `ReconnectButton`. This is the reshaped answer to gate G2: a calendar-dependent "today's meetings" list isn't buildable yet (no Calendar OAuth, and `meeting` activities carry no scheduled date), so the valuable half — last-contact recency + a reconnect nudge — ships now; the real calendar-invite upgrade is ORR-724.
- **Inline quick-create for the Account relation picker (#290):** typing a new account name in the opportunity form's **Account** picker and confirming now creates it inline (the empty-state offers **`+ Create "…"`**), then selects it and unlocks the (already account-gated) Primary Contact picker. New `createAccountQuickAction` reuses the existing `createAccount` data path (`{ user, source }`, RLS + `created_by` trigger + audit; owner = current user) and returns the `EntityCombobox` option shape. Reuses the existing `EntityCombobox` creatable primitive — Contact quick-create was already wired; this closes the Account gap. Sales Unit / Business Unit / Entity stay admin-managed (not inline-creatable). Country prefill and a near-duplicate warning are follow-ups (no fuzzy matcher exists today — the resolver's `pickRecord` is exact-match only).

### Fixed

- **Opportunity Generator RFP uploads failed with a generic "analysing" error (ORR-710):** Next's default **1 MB** server-action body limit rejected real PDF/DOCX uploads before `extractDocumentTextAction` ran. Raised the upload cap to **50 MB** (`experimental.serverActions.bodySizeLimit` + the action's own size check) and surfaced a "max 50 MB" note in the upload step.
- **Dashboard metric tiles clipped the value on mobile (ORR-718, #283):** `KpiCard` laid the value and the top-right icon out in a single horizontal band, so a wide currency value (no wrap point) overflowed under the `shrink-0` icon and the card's `overflow-hidden` clipped the right edge on ~360–390px screens ("$150,000" → "$150,00"). The label + icon now share a header row and the value drops to its own full-width line below.
- **Dashboard metrics — wrong average deal size + currency mixing (ORR-693, #286):** `avgDealSize` divided the total deal value (summed over won + lost + active deals) by a denominator that omitted lost deals, inflating the figure; it now divides by the full converted population. `getRecentDeals` returned each deal's **raw** amount with no FX conversion, yet the dashboard formats recent-deal amounts with the reporting-currency formatter — so a ₹ deal rendered as "$…". It now converts each amount to the reporting currency and keeps an unconvertible deal in its **own** currency (rather than mislabelling it or dropping it); `RecentDealRecord` gained a `currency`. (`getStuckDeals` already converted — no sibling bug.)
- **Stage change via the edit form skipped history + notifications (ORR-694, #287):** a stage moved through the general `updateOpportunity` path (e.g. the full-edit form) persisted the new stage but wrote no stage-history entry and sent no stage-change notification — only the dedicated `updateOpportunityStage` did. `updateOpportunity` now records history and fires `notifyStageChange` on a real stage change, matching the dedicated path.
- **Protected pages returned HTTP 500 when unauthenticated (ORR-712, #289):** `requireUser()` threw on no session, and in a server-component render that uncaught throw rendered Next's 500 boundary instead of redirecting — so **every** `(crm)` page returned 500 to unauthenticated requests (bookmarks after logout, shared links, uptime probes). Page / server-action callers (no `request` arg) now `redirect("/login")`; API / route-handler callers (which pass `request`) still get the `UnauthorisedError` throw so they return a proper 401.

### Changed

- **Generator: drop a document anywhere in the viewport (ORR-710):** while the "Generate from a document" step is open, a dropped file is now accepted **anywhere on screen** (with a full-screen drop overlay), not only on the small dashed box — much easier on large / 1440p displays.
- **Removed the redundant "Quick Create" from the pipeline board (ORR-710):** superseded by the unified "Create Opportunity" entry (ORR-681). Deleted the orphaned `OpportunityQuickCreate` component and its test.

### Security

- **Approval enforce-gate scoped to the wrong entity — fail-open (ORR-695, #288):** `opportunity_check_enforce_gate` matched per-entity approval workflows on the opportunity's `billing_entity_id` (nullable and independent of the sales unit) instead of the sales-unit-derived business entity the rest of the subsystem uses. Whenever billing entity was NULL or different, an entity's enforce-gate workflow was **silently skipped** and a rep could advance the stage past its trigger with no approved approval — the worst direction for an enforcement control. A new migration resolves the entity exactly like `submit_opportunity_for_approval` (`sales_unit_id → business_units.entity_id`).
- **One-pending-approval-per-opportunity now enforced at the DB (ORR-695, #288):** added a partial unique index (`approval_instances(entity_id) WHERE entity_type='opportunity' AND status='pending'`) so the single-pending invariant no longer relies solely on an app/RPC `EXISTS` check that a direct admin insert or a second write path could race. Terminal states are excluded, so re-submitting after a prior instance resolves is unaffected.
- **`getApprovalActionState` role branch missing the entity firewall (ORR-695, #288):** it offered the Approve/Reject affordance to role-based approvers in the **wrong entity** (the server write still rejected it via `record_approval_decision`, but the UI gate diverged from the enforcement gate + RLS). It now firewalls the role branch by the caller's `primary_entity_id` vs the instance's `business_entity_id`, failing closed when the instance has no business entity. Named-approver, multi-approver, and admin branches are unchanged.

## 2026-07-12

### Added

- **Per-deal revenue schedule editor on the opportunity P&L tab (ORR-707, first half of ORR-689):** the previously-disabled **"Set Revenue Schedule"** button now opens an editor that spreads the deal's amount across its service months (flat template you can adjust), validating that the months sum to the deal amount before saving via the atomic `replace_revenue_schedule` RPC. The P&L tab (unlocked at Verbal Agreement) shows the saved schedule as a read-only table instead of a "coming soon" placeholder. Wires new `getRevenueScheduleAction` / `saveRevenueScheduleAction` server actions over the existing (previously UI-less) `lib/data/revenue-schedule.ts`. The full P&L summary + cost milestones (netting the schedule against costs into the working-capital model) land next (ORR-708).
- **Opportunity Generator now accepts PDF and DOCX uploads (ORR-684):** dropping a real RFP file into the "Generate from a document" flow now works, not just `.txt`/`.eml`/`.md`. A new `extractDocumentTextAction` server action pulls text from the upload via the shared ingestion extractor (`lib/ingestion/extract.ts`) — PDF was already supported there (unpdf); this adds **DOCX** parsing (mammoth), which also benefits document ingestion. Text files are still read in the browser (no round-trip); PDF/DOCX go server-side (15 MB cap, scanned-PDF "no text layer" message). `extractText` was decoupled from the Drive `DriveFile` type to a minimal `{bytes, mimeType}` shape. Chooser copy/accept-list updated; the "PDF/DOCX coming soon" note is gone.
- **`<SaveBar>` primitive — unified unsaved-changes bar (UI Convention Retrofit P1-T6 / G1, ORR-671, #250):** `primitives/save-bar.tsx` — a fixed bottom bar that slides in while a form/section has unsaved changes and offers Save / Discard (with a saving state), plus unit tests. Implements the app-wide save model (not autosave). Not yet adopted — the opportunity and settings recompositions wire it in.

### Changed

- **Unified unsaved-changes bar on Settings form tabs (UI Convention Retrofit G1, ORR-687):** the **Profile** and **Localization** settings tabs now dirty-track against a last-saved baseline and surface the shared `SaveBar` primitive (**Save changes / Discard**, with a saving state) instead of their own inline "Save profile" / "Save localization" buttons — the bar slides in only while there are unsaved edits and hides on save/discard. Toggle-style sections keep instant save: **Notifications** and **Appearance** still save on change (single-toggle instant-save is better UX), so they were deliberately not converted. Opportunity detail keeps its modal Cancel/Save. First adoption of the previously-unused `SaveBar`; mirrors the admin `role-matrix` dirty-diff pattern. (Stepper genericisation stays deferred — ORR-688 — since `StageTracker` has only one consumer.)
- **New Opportunity entry unified — Pipeline and the table view now open the AI generator (ORR-677 follow-up, ORR-681):** the Opportunity Generator chooser was only reachable from the Opportunities page, and only in kanban / empty state — the populated **table** view had no create button, and the **Pipeline** page's "Create Opportunity" opened the plain form because it wasn't passed `generateAction`. Now the Pipeline page passes `generateOpportunityAction`, and `OpportunitiesView` renders a persistent header **"Create Opportunity"** control in table view (a shared `createControl` reused by the empty state), so every view and page opens the same create flow — the AI chooser when available, the plain form otherwise. Same underlying `createOpportunity` path; no data changes.
- **User timezone + date-format preferences now applied to rendering across the app (UI Convention Retrofit follow-up, ORR-679):** dates and times everywhere in the CRM now render in the user's chosen date format **and** IANA timezone, not a hardcoded `en-US`/ambient zone. A new client `PreferencesProvider` (`components/providers/preferences-provider.tsx`) is seeded once by the `(crm)` layout from `getUserPreferences` and exposes `usePreferences()` → `formatDate` / `formatDateTime`; `lib/format.ts` gained an optional `timeZone` argument. Migrated ~21 formatter sites (record lists, opportunity/account/contact detail, admin lists, documents, activities, notifications, API tokens, custom fields, and the dashboard trio — which drop their `dateFormat` prop) off their inline formatters onto the context. Convergence, not timezone-only: sites that previously ignored the date-format preference now honor it too, matching the dashboard. Users with no timezone set are unaffected (a null zone renders in the ambient zone, exactly as before). Retires the "being migrated" note from the Localization settings copy.
- **Settings polish — timezone combobox + sidebar de-dup (UI Convention Retrofit follow-up, #268):** replaced the free-text Timezone input with a searchable IANA-timezone combobox (reuses `EntityCombobox` + `Intl.supportedValuesOf("timeZone")`), and removed the now-redundant sidebar **"API tokens"** dropdown item — it's the Access tokens tab under Settings since #261. Timezone is still stored-but-unused for rendering (the "being migrated" note stays accurate); actually applying it to date formatting is a separate follow-up. SaveBar (G1) adoption and the Stepper genericisation remain deferred (they need visual review).
- **Contacts detail recomposed onto the record-detail pattern (UI Convention Retrofit — Contacts, Phase 4, #266):** applied the record-detail pattern to the contact page — `RecordHeader` (name + title subtitle + Email / Phone / Primary account / Owner stat strip, keeping the `OwnerLink`) + `FacetTabs` (**Details · Activity**), **no rail**. Contacts are light enough that a separate Overview tab would only duplicate Details, so the stat strip serves as the at-a-glance. Details holds the contact fields + also-linked accounts + socials + custom fields; Activity holds the notes composer + timeline. Parity: same data, edit form and actions — reorganised, nothing dropped. Completes the Phase-4 Accounts/Contacts pass.
- **Accounts detail recomposed onto the record-detail pattern (UI Convention Retrofit — Accounts, Phase 4, #262):** applied the Opportunity blueprint to the account page — `RecordHeader` (name + Owner / Country / # Opportunities / # Contacts stat strip) + top `FacetTabs` (Overview · Details · Contacts · Opportunities · Files · Activity) + a persistent **rail** (Quick facts + a **Brand guidelines** pinned-document slot, reusing the existing `brand_guidelines` document category — no migration). Overview carries key-details / recent-activity peeks + the relationship tree; Details holds the account fields + description + tax IDs + custom fields; Contacts / Opportunities / Files / Activity each get their own tab. Parity: same data, edit form, attach/detach and all actions — reorganised, nothing dropped. Added a `columns` prop to `PinnedDocumentSlots` so the rail brand slot renders full-width. Contacts detail is the next page in this pass.
- **Personal settings recomposed into tabs + accurate integration copy (UI Convention Retrofit ORR-673, #261):** restructured the stacked settings sections into top `FacetTabs` (Profile · Localization · Notifications · Appearance · Access tokens · Integrations · Security) per `settings-top-tabs.html`. Folded the API-tokens UI in as the **Access tokens** tab (extracted `ApiTokensPanel`, still reused by the standalone `/settings/api-tokens` route). Corrected stale copy (per the 2026-07-12 audit): Google Drive is a live **per-user import** (was "Not connected"); dropped the "AI agent (MCP) token — Coming soon" row for a "Personal access tokens → Access tokens tab" pointer; Slack shown as "Coming soon" (removed the false "managed by admin" claim); Security lists all real sign-in methods (Google + password + magic link + email code), not Google-only. Parity: same server actions and per-section save/autosave. Deferred to follow-ups: SaveBar (G1) adoption and the timezone→combobox. Sidebar still links `/settings/api-tokens` separately (nav de-dup is a follow-up).
- **Facet tabs — fix the tab-bar rule drawing across the tabs (ORR-672 follow-up, #258):** the base `ui/tabs` list is a fixed `h-9` (36px), but the 18px facet tabs are taller, so the list's `border-b` rule rendered *through* the tabs above their true bottom (visible as a faint offset line, esp. on large screens). Override the list to `h-auto items-end` so it grows to the tab height and the rule sits flush under them. Completes the #255 alignment attempt.
- **Facet tabs — align the active underline with the bar's bottom rule (ORR-672 follow-up, #255):** added `-mb-px` to each tab so its 2px underline overlaps the list's `border-b` (mirrors the mock's `margin-bottom:-1px`), removing the faint doubled/offset hairline under the tab row.
- **Facet tabs → underline style with a larger 18px label (ORR-672 follow-up, #254):** reverted the filled-segmented pill back to the underline treatment (Orrin), bumping the label to 18px for prominence; active tab = semibold + primary-tinted label with a primary underline, inactive muted (hover darkens). Supersedes #253. Single consumer today (opportunity detail); canonical `FacetTabs` style for the settings recomposition (ORR-673).
- **Facet tabs → filled segmented style (ORR-672 follow-up, #253):** the active `FacetTabs` tab now reads as a filled primary-tint pill (`bg-primary/10` + `text-primary`, semibold, 16px; hover fills muted) instead of the underline treatment — chosen (Orrin) for stronger at-a-glance "where am I" prominence. Single consumer today (opportunity detail); sets the canonical tab style for the settings recomposition (ORR-673).
- **Opportunity detail polish — rename Cash Plan → P&L, more prominent facet tabs (ORR-672 follow-up, #252):** renamed the gated "Cash Plan" tab and its locked/unlocked copy to **P&L** (Orrin, staging review). Bumped the `FacetTabs` primitive to match the approved mock — 15px, medium→semibold, primary-tinted active label with a wider gap (was 13px / foreground active). `FacetTabs` currently has a single consumer (the opportunity detail page), so the primitive change is contained; it also lands the canonical prominence for the settings recomposition (ORR-673).
- **Opportunity detail recomposed onto the approved mock (UI Convention Retrofit ORR-672, #251):** restructured `opportunity-detail-wrapper.tsx` into the `opportunity-reorganized.html` layout — top-level `FacetTabs` (Overview · Details · Files · Activity · Team & Splits · Cash Plan) with the persistent rail slimmed to Approval + Deal Copilot. Overview surfaces the pinned document band plus "Key details" / "Recent activity" peek cards that jump to their full tabs; Files becomes its own tab (decision C2); Team, Splits and Stage History move out of the rail (Stage History folds into an Activity sub-segment alongside All/Notes/Calls/Email); the Cash Plan tab is gated with a `locked` glyph until the deal reaches Verbal Agreement. Parity change: same data, server actions, edit sheet and empty-field "Add" affordances — reorganised, nothing dropped. SaveBar (G1) not yet wired here; the activity composer keeps its own save. Tests updated to navigate the new tab structure.
- **Canonical `<FacetTabs>` primitive (UI Convention Retrofit P1-T5, ORR-669, #249):** promoted the inline underline-facet tab styling into `primitives/facet-tabs.tsx` (`FacetTabs`/`FacetTabsList`/`FacetTabsTab`/`FacetTabsPanel`, layered on `ui/tabs`, with a `locked` glyph affordance for gated tabs), and adopted it in the opportunity Communications tab bar. Byte-identical styling; no behaviour or visual change. Route-sync + rail-slot deferred to the recomposition where they're wired and verifiable.
- **Extract `StageTracker` to its own module (UI Convention Retrofit P1-T4, ORR-670, #248):** moved the interactive deal-stage stepper out of the 756-line `opportunity-detail-wrapper.tsx` into `components/opportunities/stage-tracker.tsx` (byte-identical markup; stays interactive per convention decision C1). No behaviour or visual change. Full genericisation into a shared `primitives/stepper.tsx` deferred to the recomposition, where it can be visually verified against the mock.
- **Canonical `<RecordHeader>` primitive (UI Convention Retrofit P1-T3, ORR-668, #247):** extracted the opportunity detail header (title + subtitle + actions slot + hairline stat strip) into shared `primitives/record-header.tsx` and adopted it in `opportunity-detail-wrapper.tsx` — removed the local `StatCell`, moved the header/stat markup behind `RecordHeader` with `stats`/`actions` props. Byte-identical markup; no behaviour or visual change. Stat strip keeps its hairline treatment (KpiCard unification deferred — different visual). Accounts/Contacts adopt in Phase 4.
- **Canonical read-only field primitive (UI Convention Retrofit P1-T7, ORR-667, #246):** promoted the opportunity wrapper's local `DField` into shared `DefinitionField` / `DefinitionFieldGrid` in `primitives/definition-grid.tsx` (label/value with `add`/`hide`/`dash` empty modes and the `+ Add` affordance), and adopted them in `opportunity-detail-wrapper.tsx` — removed the local `DField`/`isEmpty` and routed all field rows + the two hand-rolled `<dl>` grids through the primitive. Byte-identical markup; no behaviour or visual change.
- **Opportunity components use semantic color tokens (UI Convention Retrofit P1-T2, ORR-666, #245):** routed the remaining `amber-*`/`green-*` Tailwind literals in `opportunity-card.tsx`, `opportunity-detail-wrapper.tsx`, and `opportunity-splits-editor.tsx` to the existing `--warning`/`--success` tokens (`bg-warning/*`, `text-warning`, `text-success`). Redundant `dark:` amber variants dropped — the tokens carry their own dark values. Parity change only; no behaviour or layout change.

### CI

- **`scripts/ship-pr.sh` — retry the post-rebase head-check (#265):** after a rebase + force-push, GitHub lags a few seconds before the PR's `headRefOid` reflects the new commit; the one-shot check read the stale head and aborted (seen shipping #262). Poll the head up to ~30s until it matches local HEAD. Failed safe (no branch deleted) but needed a manual re-run — this makes the rebase path robust for concurrent merges.
- **`scripts/ship-pr.sh` — concurrent-safe PR shipper (#259):** encodes the safe merge sequence so multiple agents/SSH instances merge identically without the "blocked merge reported as success, branch deleted anyway" failure. Rebases-if-behind → verifies PR head == local HEAD → waits for CI → squash-merges → **confirms `state == MERGED` before deleting the branch** → mirrors `main` to the `nodwin` remote → watches the deploy, looping the rebase→merge across merge races. Documented in `AGENTS.md` §8.3.

### Docs

- **UI Convention Retrofit — Phase 1 baseline (ORR-664, ORR-665, #244):** added the canonical UI convention at `docs/ui-conventions.md` (canonical primitives, save model, token rules, banked decisions, open conflicts), preserved the signed-off Phase-0 discovery note at `docs/retrofit/phase-0-discovery.md`, and committed the three approved design mocks under `docs/retrofit/mocks/`. Resolves decision C2 (Orrin, 2026-07-12): the approved mocks are canonical, so Files becomes a facet tab (pinned RFP/Proposal/Contract slots on Overview), superseding the earlier Files-inline position. Docs only; no product code.

## 2026-07-11

### Added

- **REST API for external agents:** token-authed read endpoints (Phase 1, #224) and v1 write endpoints — create/update with activity logging (Phase 2, #229). Agent-integration guide added at `docs/rest-api.md` (#226), made explicit that it "works with any agent, not just Claude" (#228), plus NanoClaw wiring gotchas learned in practice (#227).
- **Cash-flow milestones:** `cashflow_milestone` table + RLS (Phase 1, #232) and working-capital derivation for milestones (Phase 2, #231). Data model + resolved decisions codified against the SOW (#230).
- **Finance admin section** with cost-of-cash settings (#225).
- **Grouped admin settings navigation** — the flat admin list regrouped into labelled, collapsible sections (Ticket A, #233).
- **Documents band on accounts** with a shared pinned-slots component (#221).

### Changed

- **Opportunity detail layout rebalanced (ORR-658, T-059):** wide column carries deal fields + a Communications tab group; the right rail holds compact summary cards. Documents promoted from a tab to an always-visible band under the stage bar (deliberate deviation from T-059 — deals here are document-centric). Layout only; no schema/RLS change (#219).

### Fixed

- Ingestion now reads file bytes from Supabase Storage and extracts PDF text (#220).
- Opportunities resolve contact + entity names — never show raw ids (#223).
- Removed duplicate chevron on admin section headers (#234).
- Sidebar **Admin** label now links to the `/admin` overview page; a separate chevron toggles the section list (previously clicking Admin only expanded/collapsed the menu) (#239).

### CI

- Apply DB migrations automatically on deploy (ORR-197, #222).

### Docs

- Reconstructed per-day changelog entries for June 17 – July 11 (#236).
- `AGENTS.md`: require a per-PR `CHANGELOG.md` entry — added a changelog step to §8.3 and a `## Changelog` field to the §8.4 PR template (#237).
- Documentation accuracy sweep — deploy/infra: corrected the "migrations are manual / not in the pipeline" claim across `supabase-environments.md`, `deploy/DEPLOYMENT.md`, `deploy/README.md`, and `SUPABASE-SETUP.md` (migrations auto-apply on deploy, ORR-197); README Supabase CLI `1.x`→`2.x` + `deploy.yml` listed (#240).
- Documentation accuracy sweep — runbook: reconciled `docs/runbook-incident.md` to the self-hosted VPS (Docker Compose restart not PM2; deploy apply-migrations not `pnpm db:migrate`; backup/restore flagged as TODO — Cloud-dashboard steps don't apply on self-host); fixed the §7 verification gate + `scripts/verify.sh` to curl port `3030` not `3002` (#241).
- Documentation accuracy sweep — feature-state: re-audited `docs/ROADMAP.md` to 2026-07-11 (several shipped features were still marked unbuilt); `docs/data-model.md` (drop `sales_initiator_user_id`, rewrite Documents for Supabase Storage, add the missing shipped tables); `docs/security.md` §8.3.1 (Confidential masking, custom Roles & Permissions, Entity Admin, tier-filtered RAG); `docs/integrations.md` (Drive import shipped); `BUILD_TICKETS.md` + `paperclip-org-chart.md` (secret-scan removed); `docs/rest-api.md` (sample now read+write) (#242).
- **Worktree guideline:** new `docs/WORKTREES.md` + `AGENTS.md` §11.5 — worktrees are keyed to a ticket (not a per-agent home), live under `~/crm-worktrees/<ticket>`, and are retired the moment their PR merges. Codifies the cleanup that removed 12 stale worktrees and ~180 merged branches, and documents why the legacy per-agent (Paperclip) layout was retired.

## 2026-07-10

### Security

- Closed a Standard-tier leak in knowledge search that shipped in #166 (#167).

### Removed

## 2026-07-03

### Added

- **Per-user settings page** + display-currency preference (ORR-615, #139).
- **Two-tier admin RBAC:** Entity Admin role + entity-scoped settings RLS (ORR-618, #142); Entity Admins manage their own entity's users (ORR-619, #145).
- **Users & Roles admin** — role / entity / manager / status (ORR-617, #141).

> Note: `main` was consolidated on this date (the `temp-main-merge` integration), which is why the June 17–19 work below carries a July 1 commit date on `main`.

## 2026-06-19

### Added

- Opportunity create/edit form + Salesforce-style detail page (ORR-545 / ORR-554 / ORR-555, #100, #101, #102).

- **Companies:** companies list page + sidebar nav (ORR-466) and company detail (ORR-467) (#81, #82).
- **Schema build-out:** `opportunity_revenue_schedule` for custom recurring revenue splits (ORR-491); Data Management schema — `finance_export_config` + `import_jobs` (ORR-527); financial settings tables — `reporting_currency_settings`, `fiscal_year_settings`, `approval_thresholds`, `revenue_recognition_defaults`; integration config — `integration_settings`, `slack_connections`, `email_settings`, `salesforce_connections` (ORR-518, #92); entity branding columns + `relationship_types` lookup + enum→text FK migration (ORR-512); `deleted_at` soft-delete on accounts.

## 2026-05-06

### Added

- **AI provider adapters (ORR-177):** Five provider adapters shipped — Anthropic (Messages API), Gemini (Generative Language API), DeepSeek, Moonshot/Kimi, and Ollama. Env-driven factory (`createAdaptersFromEnv`) with AbortController + 30s timeout on all providers. Cap enforcement via `lib/ai/cap-enforcement.ts` with per-user/team/company ceilings, tested at $1 cap boundary.
- **Multi-approver vote aggregation (ORR-132):** XState approval state machine supporting `any_one` and `all_required` modes across sequential steps. Handles per-approver voting, skip, rejection.
- **Deal-stage state machine (ORR-178):** XState deal-stage machine with forward/backward/force/reopen transitions and stage history tracking.
